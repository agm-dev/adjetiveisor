# Adjetiveisor
That looks like a job for the Night Watch...


You can clone and run:

>`npm install`

To run the tests, writen with `jest` use:

>`npm test`

If you wanna make modifications on the code and run the tests on save run:

>`npm test -- --watch`

Feel free to pull request, but please, use `standard` to fix your code before doing it. You can install globally and fix your code with the next commands:

>`npm install standard -g`

>`standard --fix`

Adjetiveisor uses some rules of spanish language to try to figure out what gender and number must use. It is really far from being perfect, so please, if you find some better rules, make me a pull request with some tests that proves a better performance.

This script is translated from a two years old php script, so probably there are better and nicer ways to write this on javascript.
